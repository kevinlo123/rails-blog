## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, SqlLite, 

I built this project to further my knowledge with full stack development. The blog is a simple controller directing CRUD operations on the SqlLite database entries and rendering the result of those actions in the projects views as blog posts. I enjoy programming in ruby for the simplicity and the way it reads like english. Stay tuned for more!
